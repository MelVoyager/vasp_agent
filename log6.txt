To accomplish this task, we need to write a Python script that modifies the lattice constant in a file, runs a subprocess to execute a simulation, extracts the energy from the output, and then plots the results. Finally, it will determine the lattice constant with the lowest energy.

Here's the complete Python program:

```python
import subprocess
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def modify_lattice_constant(file_path, lattice_constant):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    
    # Assuming the lattice constant is on the second line
    lines[1] = f"{lattice_constant}\n"
    
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.writelines(lines)

def run_simulation(script_path):
    result = subprocess.run(['bash', script_path], capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout

def extract_energy(output):
    # Assuming energy is in a line that contains 'energy' keyword
    for line in output.splitlines():
        if 'energy' in line.lower():
            # Extract the energy value from the line
            return float(line.split()[-1])
    return None

def main():
    poscar_path = './test/gen/POSCAR'
    script_path = './test/gen/script.sh'
    
    lattice_constants = np.linspace(3.5, 4.5, 11)  # Example range of lattice constants
    energies = []

    for lc in lattice_constants:
        modify_lattice_constant(poscar_path, lc)
        output = run_simulation(script_path)
        energy = extract_energy(output)
        if energy is not None:
            energies.append(energy)
        else:
            print(f"Failed to extract energy for lattice constant {lc}")
            energies.append(float('inf'))

    # Plotting
    plt.plot(lattice_constants, energies, marker='o')
    plt.xlabel('Lattice Constant')
    plt.ylabel('Energy')
    plt.title('Energy vs Lattice Constant')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

    # Find the lattice constant with the lowest energy
    min_energy_index = np.argmin(energies)
    optimal_lattice_constant = lattice_constants[min_energy_index]
    print(f"The optimal lattice constant is: {optimal_lattice_constant}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script performs the following steps:
1. Modifies the lattice constant in the `POSCAR` file.
2. Runs the simulation using a bash script.
3. Extracts the energy from the simulation output.
4. Plots the energy against the lattice constant.
5. Identifies and prints the lattice constant with the lowest energy.

Make sure the paths and assumptions about the file structure and output format are correct for your specific setup. Adjust the lattice constant range and extraction logic as needed.
